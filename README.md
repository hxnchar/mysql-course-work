# Databases Course Work (H2'21)
## Assignment ‚úçÔ∏è
I had to design and implement a comprehensive database to support the examination and grade session processes. The following steps must be taken to achieve this:

-   Build an ER diagram and a database schema;
-   Create and fill the database with records;
-   Create scripts and queries in the SQL language;
-   Optimize the scripts to minimize time. 

Additional requirements include:
-   Use of triggers;
-   Use of generators;
-   Use of views;

The database design must incorporate at least 10 entities and use at least 2 tables in each query. 
Additionally, it is crucial to implement measures to ensure the protection of data from unauthorized access. This includes the creation of user roles with varying levels of rights and restrictions, such as "student" who can only view information, "teacher" who can edit, add, and delete information, and "admin" who has full access to the database.
